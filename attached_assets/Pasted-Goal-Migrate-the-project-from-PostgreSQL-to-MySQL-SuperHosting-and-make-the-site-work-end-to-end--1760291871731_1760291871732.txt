Goal: Migrate the project from PostgreSQL to MySQL (SuperHosting) and make the site work end-to-end with the new DB.

Target MySQL credentials (SuperHosting):

Host: localhost

Database: yogahonc_consultingg78

Username: yogahonc_consultingg78

Password: PoloSport88*

Charset/collation: utf8mb4 / utf8mb4_unicode_ci

Tasks:

Create MySQL dumps & backups of current data

Export current Postgres data from the app into portable CSV/SQL (properties, property_images, users, pages, sections, services). Keep the exports in /exports/ so I can download them.

Convert schema to MySQL

Generate a MySQL-compatible schema from the current Postgres schema.

Mappings: SERIAL → INT AUTO_INCREMENT, BOOLEAN → TINYINT(1), TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE → DATETIME, TEXT/VARCHAR unchanged (use utf8mb4), NOW() → CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.

Replace double-quoted identifiers with backticks; remove Postgres-only features (e.g., RETURNING, USING, extensions).

Ensure FKs, indexes, and ON DELETE/UPDATE rules are preserved.

Load data into MySQL

Create the consultingg database (or use the existing one) and import the converted schema.

Load the exported data into the MySQL tables (preserving IDs and relationships).

Update the backend to use MySQL (PDO)

In backend/config/database.php: switch to a MySQL DSN (mysql:host=localhost;dbname=consultingg;charset=utf8mb4) and use PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => "SET NAMES utf8mb4" if needed.

Replace any Postgres-specific SQL in backend/models/** and controllers:

Remove RETURNING id; use $pdo->lastInsertId() instead.

Replace ILIKE with LIKE and add COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci if case-insensitive is required.

Ensure LIMIT/OFFSET syntax stays LIMIT :limit OFFSET :offset (works in MySQL).

Use TINYINT(1) for booleans; cast to bool in PHP where returned.

Keep prepared statements and parameter binding as is.

Environment configuration for production

Create/update backend/.env with:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=yogahonc_consultingg78
DB_USERNAME=yogahonc_consultingg78
DB_PASSWORD=PoloSport88*
DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
DB_COLLATION=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false


Ensure the app reads these vars and does not rely on DATABASE_URL anymore.

Smoke tests (must pass)

Add a temporary backend/db_mysql_check.php that connects using the env above and returns JSON {ok:true, db:'consultingg'}.

Verify /api/ health, /api/properties, property detail, admin login, and image upload paths.

Confirm thumbnail generation still works and file permissions in uploads/ are OK.

Output & handoff

Provide:

The MySQL schema file you applied, the import logs, and any changed PHP files.

A short README with exactly what was changed and where (files/queries touched).

A compact list of Postgres→MySQL query changes made.

Notes/constraints:

Do not remove any business logic; only adapt SQL/DSN.

Keep JWT/auth, CORS, and uploads behavior unchanged.

Assume SuperHosting has pdo_mysql enabled.

When done, confirm everything works locally in Replit against a MySQL instance, then I will upload the code and .env to SuperHosting (host=localhost).
